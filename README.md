# TryGooglingThatBot
🔍 The bot for people that are too lazy to search something.

Everyone knows at least one person who usually asks things that he can search on Google: with this bot, you can ditch him in seconds.
This bot makes you able to do a search on some search engines and it makes fun of the questioning person.
